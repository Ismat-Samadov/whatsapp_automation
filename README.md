Automate some aspect of your life using Python.
Certainly, here's an example of a descriptive README file for your Python script that sends WhatsApp messages at a 15-second interval using the `pywhatkit` library. You can customize this README file to suit your project's specific needs.

# WhatsApp Message Sender

## Overview

This Python script uses the `pywhatkit` library to send WhatsApp messages at a 15-second interval. It allows you to automate the process of sending messages to a specific recipient with a country code.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- `pywhatkit` library (install it using `pip install pywhatkit`)
- A stable internet connection
- WhatsApp Web opened and logged in

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages if you haven't already:

   pip install pywhatkit

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python autoamated_check.py
   

4. You will be prompted to enter the recipient's phone number with a country code (e.g., +1234567890).

5. The script will then send a predefined message every 15 seconds using the `pywhatkit` library's `p.sendwhatmsg_instantly` function.

6. You can stop the script by manually terminating it.

## Customization

- You can customize the message content and the interval at which messages are sent by editing the script.

- Be cautious and responsible when automating messaging applications like WhatsApp, as this may be subject to the platform's terms of service and ethical considerations.

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling to catch exceptions that may occur during the message sending process. If any errors occur, they will be displayed in the console.
